# Untitled Robot Game

A platform puzzle game. The player can move left and right, and ride elevators up and down. The player must rearrange wired circuitry within the level, which will toggle power to buttons (that open doors) and force fields (that block the way).

I've been working on this idea for a while, so I already have some features implemented.

## Features

* Player can move left and right, but not through walls
* Player can ride elevators up and down
* Player can pass through open doors, but not closed doors
* Player can push buttons, which open doors
* Player can pick up items from "cubbies" and place them in different cubbies
* Power is delivered to different objects depending on the items placed in the cubbies
* Players cannot pass through force fields when they have power
* Player can receive a power-up that allows them to extend the height of their robot, allowing them to reach more cubbies
* Player can rotate items
* 3 Levels (or more?) of increasing difficulty
* In-game instructions that explain how to play
