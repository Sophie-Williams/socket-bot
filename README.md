In this game, you are a robot. You can move left and right using the arrow keys. You can also ride elevators up and down using the arrow keys.

Your goal is to reach the red elevators. They'll take you up to the next level.

Blocking your way will be doors and force fields. You can't pass through force fields with power. Doors are opened by buttons, but a button won't work unless it has power.

You will need to change the flow of power to overcome these obstacles. You can change the flow of power by inserting/removing panels into/from sockets. Press SPACEBAR while in front of a socket to insert or remove a panel.

You can increase the height of your robot by collecting spring power-ups. You can then use the up and down keys to adjust your height.
